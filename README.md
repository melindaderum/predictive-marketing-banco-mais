# Banco Mais: Marketing Strategy & Predictive Targeting

## 1. Background and Overview
Banco Mais was struggling with a campaign inefficiency problem. They were calling a lot of customers who weren't interested in their term deposits, leading to mixed results. My goal was to look at their data, find which groups were actually saying "yes," and create a plan to get their success rate above the current 40% baseline.

## 2. Data Structure Overview
I analyzed a dataset of **10,000 customer records** focusing on age, account balances, and existing loan status. I followed the 6-step **Data Analytics Life Cycle**, using Excel to clean the data, run regressions, and validate that the findings were reliable enough to drive business decisions.

## 3. Executive Summary
After looking at the data, I found that **Age, Balance, and Loan Status** are the three biggest predictors of whether someone will subscribe. 
* **Top Performing Segment:** Customers aged **64 and older** convert at **51%** (an 11% lift over the baseline). 
* **High Risk Segment:** People who already have **personal loans** only convert at **36%**, which falls below the average and signals wasted marketing spend. 

## 4. Insights Deep Dive
* **The Age Factor:** Success rates go up as customers get older. The 55+ and 64+ groups showed much higher interest in these deposits than younger demographics.
* **The Impact of Debt:** Having a personal loan is a major deterrent. Calling these customers is largely an unproductive use of resources because they convert 4% lower than the baseline.
* **Model Reality Check:** While age and debt are strong signals, they don't tell the whole story. This analysis provides an immediate path to improvement, but further behavioral data is needed for a 100% comprehensive strategy.

## 5. Recommendations
* **Prioritize High-Conversion Segments:** Shift marketing budget and labor hours toward the **55+ and 64+ age brackets**.
* **Implement Exclusion Rules:** Immediately stop calling customers with existing personal loans to save on operational costs.
* **Tailor the Message:** For older segments, marketing creative should focus on **security, fixed rates, and retirement stability** rather than generic offers.
* **Maintain Ethical Standards:** Future targeting must use anonymous IDs and regular bias audits to ensure data privacy and fairness.
